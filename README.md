# Dougclectica Rebooted

Development blog topics, originally (largely manually) pulled in from my [sunset](https://developer.ibm.com/code/dw-connections-sunset-faq/) [blog on DeveloperWorks](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/Dougclectica/).

I now [have Search and Commenting](https://dougbreaux.github.io/2020/10/14/How-this-Blog-is-Built.html).
