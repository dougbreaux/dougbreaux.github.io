[Form Filler Bookmarklet](http://www.benjaminkeen.com/open-source-projects/smaller-projects/form-filler-bookmarklet/) from Benjamin Keen

There are a number of browser plugins for remembering and automatically filling in form fields, but this is a nice, lightweight approach I've been using lately to construct short-term, special-purpose [bookmarklets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) for testing particular cases on particular pages.

1.  Create the bookmark(let) with the content from the above [Form Filler Bookmarklet page](http://www.benjaminkeen.com/open-source-projects/smaller-projects/form-filler-bookmarklet/)
2.  Visit the page you're testing and fill out the form with your test values
3.  Click the bookmark(let). A small window will open which contains simple instructions and a "Form #1" link to a _new_ bookmarklet.
4.  Drag the "Form #1" bookmarklet link back to your bookmarks. Optionally rename it, put it in a folder of all your forms, etc.
5.  Whenever you need to repeat filling in that particular form with those particular values, click your new form bookmarklet
