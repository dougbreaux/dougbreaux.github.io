## REST Client

At this version of WebSphere, JAX-RS 1.1 is supported, but that doesn't include any REST Client support. JAX-RS 2.0 apparently does, but that's not yet available here on WAS 8.5.5 Full Profile. [It is on Liberty Profile](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2015/06/25/java-ee-7-has-landed-in-was-liberty/), but that's not what we're using.

However, WebSphere's JAX-RS Server support uses [Apache Wink](http://wink.apache.org/), which does include [REST Client capability](http://wink.apache.org/1.0/html/6.1%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Apache%20Wink%20Client.html). And, in fact, is the REST Client mechanism recommended by WebSphere's official documentation:

[Implementing clients that use the Apache Wink REST client](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/twbs_jaxrs_impl_client_winkrestclient.html)

Those steps are actually pretty clear and comprehensive. I'll give quick examples of the mostly-default code I used. (Showing full class packages inline, just once, for simplicity.)
```java
    org.apache.wink.client.RestClient client = new RestClient();  
    org.apache.wink.client.Resource resource = client.resource(resourceURL);  
    try {  
        MyJsonResponseDataTypeBean responseBean =  
            resource.accept(javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE)  
                    .get(MyJsonResponseDataTypeBean.class);  

       // work with or return responseBean  
    }  

    // HTTP error response codes. Unchecked Exception. Subclass of ClientRuntimeException  
    catch (org.apache.wink.client.ClientWebException e) {  
        org.apache.wink.client.ClientResponse response = e.getResponse();  
        // however you want to handle HTTP error response codes  
    }  

    // Other call errors. Also Unchecked Exception  
    catch (org.apache.wink.client.ClientRuntimeException e) {  
        // however you want to handle other exeptions  
    }
```
The [Wink Javadoc](https://wink.apache.org/1.4.0/api/index.html) shows those unchecked Exceptions for one form of the operations, like [post()](https://wink.apache.org/1.4.0/api/org/apache/wink/client/Resource.html#post%28java.lang.Object%29).

Another form of each operation does not throw that Exception, but allows you to manually check the `ClientResponse` yourself. This is how the example in the above WAS documentation does things. (_Note that even those methods do seem to throw `ClientRuntimeException` for things like communication errors, despite the javadoc not indicating that._)

### POST

Speaking of POST, here's what that looks like. With a JSON payload as well.
```java
    MyJsonResponseDataTypeBean responseBean =  
        resource.contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE)  
                .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_TYPE)  
                .post(MyJsonResponseDataTypeBean.class, MyJsonRequestDataTypeBean);
```

### Adding HTTP Basic Authentication

From another WebSphere Knowledge Center article, [Securing JAX-RS applications within the web container](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/twbs_jaxrs_impl_securejaxrs_webcont.html), which largely describes securing your JAX-RS _services_, we also find the technique for passing HTTP Basic Authentication in your Wink client requests:

```java
    org.apache.wink.client.ClientConfig config = new ClientConfig();  
    org.apache.wink.client.handlers.BasicAuthSecurityHandler handler = 
        new BasicAuthSecurityHandler(username, password);  
    config.handlers(handler);  
    RestClient client = new RestClient(config); // instead of just new RestClient()
```

## JSON Beans and Serializing/Deserializing

So what allows automatically serializing a request POJO into JSON or deserializing a response JSON into a POJO? I had some naive hope that perhaps just being a JavaBean would be sufficient. But alas, it is not.

Would I have to [manually parse the JSON, using something like com.ibm.json.java.JSONObject](http://mrbool.com/how-to-use-rest-service-with-websphere-8-5-application-server-and-send-json-data/27999)?

Thankfully, no. Also in the original WebSphere Rest Client article linked above, we find this statement:

> Instead of calling the `response.getEntity(String.class)` object with String.class file, you can use any other class that has a valid javax.ws.rs.ext.MessageBodyReader object, such as a JAXB annotated class, a byte[], or a custom class that has a custom entity provider.

JAXB annotated class, that's super simple. (Still feels a bit weird that JAXB annotations are used for JSON serialization in WAS. Don't know if other servers do this as well. But easy.) If I do this in a base class, the subclasses don't have to also add the annotation:

```java
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType;

@XmlType  
public class JsonBase {}
```

### Unwanted Fields

Hmmm... do I have to declare in the POJO every field and sub-object the JSON could have? That would be really frustrating and difficult to maintain. Maybe I'd rather just parse the fields I care about after all.

Yeah, look. If I don't declare every field, I get errors like this on deserialization:

`org.codehaus.jackson.map.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException: Unrecognized field "start" (Class MyJsonDataType), not marked as ignorable`

Jackson, eh? So WebSphere uses Jackson for its JSON serialization.

And, as usual, [StackOverflow to the rescue](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7546047/796761). [@JsonIgnoreProperties](http://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-annotations/javadoc/2.6/com/fasterxml/jackson/annotation/JsonIgnoreProperties.html) will do the trick. So change the base class to:

```java
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlType;  
import org.codehaus.jackson.annotate.JsonIgnoreProperties;

@XmlType  
@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)  
public class JsonBase {}
```

Now all subclasses only have to declare whatever fields they want parsed or sent.

## Some additional notes

* For reference, if/when moving from JAX-RS 1.1, based on Wink, to 2.0, based on CXF: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/was_beta_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.multiplatform.doc/ae/cwlp_jaxrs_behavior.html
(_Oct 2 2017_)
* FWIW, appears JAX-RS 2.0 under WebSphere no longer exposes the Jackson classes, so that will necessitate a change to this approach: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/cwlp_jaxrs_behavior.html (_Feb 15 2017_)
