Looks like the sunset of this platform is back "on" again. To be shut down December 31, 2019\. This was my notification:

> As part of the overall IBM effort to reduce the number of duplicate client interaction portals and to simplify the user experience with the digital side of IBM, I would like you to know that we are sunsetting the developerWorks Connections platform which includes all URLs starting with ibm.com/developerworks/community. Affected pages will have a banner at the top identifying it as as part of the removal scheduled for December 31, 2019.

Back to the drawing board.
