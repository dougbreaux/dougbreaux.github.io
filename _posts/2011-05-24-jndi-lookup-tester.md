[Simple JSP](https://github.com/dougbreaux/Java-Web-Tools/blob/master/WebContent/JNDITest.jsp) to perform JNDI lookups to see if the name you're querying returns the object you're expecting.

Copy this file out to an existing web application's WAR directory and visit http://yourserver/context-root/JNDITest.jsp.

Tested under WebSphere 6.1, but contains nothing specific to WebSphere. Works under WebSphere 8.5.5 Traditional and Liberty as well.
