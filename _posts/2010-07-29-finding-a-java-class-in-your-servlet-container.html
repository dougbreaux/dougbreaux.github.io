<p>An oldie, but still useful from time to time.</p>

<p>Ever wonder which Jar or directory contains a class you&#39;re using in your JEE Web Application? Or which of multiple provider Jar files is the one being used? Or even whether or not a particular class is found at all?</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/techjournal/0406_brown/0406_brown.html">this DeveloperWorks article</a>, here&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/dougbreaux/Java-Web-Tools/blob/master/WebContent/FindClass.jsp">a&nbsp;simple&nbsp;JSP</a> that can be deployed out to any Web Application to answer those questions.</p>

<p>No need to actually include it in your Web App permanently, but easy to deploy manually if you ever need it.</p>

<p>Update: <a href="https://github.com/dougbreaux/Java-Web-Tools/blob/master/WebContent/FindClass2.jsp"/>another JSP</a> that doesn't require WebSphere-specific classes.</p>
