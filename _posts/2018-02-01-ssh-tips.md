I'm normally a PuTTY user, but I'm temporarily on a *IX (MacOS) system, and learning a few simple techniques for doing [some of what I've done with PuTTY, plink, and pageant](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/Dougclectica?tags=putty). So I thought I'd jot down a few of those.

## SSH keys

First, I'm using SSH keys for much of my authentication. I may add details here later on how to create those, but it's pretty straightforward to find all over the web.

Next, `ssh-add` to add SSH keys to your system's authentication agent (what PuTTY pageant does). e.g.

`ssh-add -K /Users/breaux/my-private-key.2048.ssh`

## Proxy a hop

To proxy/hop through one host that can reach the other hosts you want to reach, use the `ProxyCommand` option. (Source of this one was fellow IBMer, <span class="vcard">[@Harley Stenzel](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/profiles/html/profileView.do?userid=0600022V4M).)

`ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p _my-proxy-server_" _my-destination-server_`

Further, I can tunnel ports, like the WebSphere administrator port, through that as well:

`ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -W %h:%p _my-proxy-server_" -L9043:_my-websphere-server_:9043 _my-destination_`

Where _my-destination_ and _my-websphere-server_ might or might not be the same server, as long as _my-destination_ can reach _my-websphere-server_ on the port being tunneled.

I'll get a login shell to _my-destination_, and a tunneled port 9043 to _my-websphere-server_, through `localhost:9043`.

## Dynamic Forwarding

Thanks, again, to Harley, this tip actually obviates some of the need for port tunneling. The -D option will dynamically forward connections through a local port, as a SOCKS server. Which... a browser can be configured to use, thus reaching any http URLs on the "other side" of that tunnel.

`ssh -D localhost:8888 _my-destination_`

#### Firefox proxy settings

I'm also currently trying out the [SwitchyOmega add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switchyomega/) to automatically switch to this proxy configuration when hitting hosts in our private domain. Thus far, it seems to be working exactly as I'd like.

## Saving SSH options

Finally, `.ssh/config` file in your home directory can contain saved configurations. Here's what mine looks like (again, largely thanks to Harley):

```
# keepalive  
ServerAliveInterval 60

# proxy  
host *.my.private.domain  
  ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p _my-proxy-server_
```

The first item is just to prevent our firewall from dropping my connection regularly. It sends a "keepalive" request every 60 seconds.

The second allows me to just type:

`ssh host1.my.private.domain`

and have that automatically use the configured proxy server via the `ProxyCommand` to connect to _host1.my.private.domain_. (Assuming that fully-qualified name resolves.)

You can also add Dynamic Forwarding to this file, with a line like this:

```
  DynamicForward localhost:8888
```
