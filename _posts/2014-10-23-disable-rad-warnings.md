title: Disable Compile Warnings in RAD

(I'm assuming this is the same in stock Eclipse, I don't have it installed right now to confirm.)

If you have any source code that is generated by tooling (say, [JAX-WS proxy code]({% post_url 2014-03-13-jax-ws-websphere8.5 %})), you might have compiler warnings for things that are not considered best-practice. (Maybe they were fine in an earlier version of Java that the tooling still supports but are redundant in a later version.)

If you're like me and you prefer to have clean packages & classes in your IDE, here's a small tip that I somehow missed until recently.

If you place your "generated" source code in a separate source folder, which I like for ease of build process as well as organizational utility, you can also tell RAD to ignore compiler warnings for that source folder.

To do this, right-click on the source folder and go to Properties. Under "Java Compiler", check the "Ignore optional compile problems" setting, and you're done.
