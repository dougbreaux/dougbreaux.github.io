title: Disabling a WebSphere Application

If you just stop an application to make it unavailable, it will still be automatically started whenever the server where it resides is restarted. To disable an application entirely, but leave it installed, you can change the "autostart" settings under the application's "Target specific application status" (WebSphere 6.1).
